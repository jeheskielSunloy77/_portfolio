I finally did it — I redesigned my portfolio website 🎉.

My old portfolio wasn’t _bad_… but let’s be real: it was **pretty crowded**. Too many colors, too much content, and not enough breathing room. It felt like I was trying to show _everything_ at once, and in the end, it just got overwhelming (for me and probably for anyone visiting 😅).

So I decided to take a step back, rethink the design, and make space for what actually matters.

## Before: A Colorful Mess 🌈

My first portfolio was loud. Think: lots of bright colors, multiple sections stacked on top of each other, and a design that screamed _“look at me!”_.

It was fun at the time, but the more I looked at it, the more I felt it didn’t represent the way I want my work to be seen. Instead of highlighting my projects and skills, the design itself became the main character.

If you’re curious (or just want to roast my old design 😂), you can still check out the **old portfolio demo here**: [Old Portfolio Demo](/oldportfolio)

## After: Clean, Modern, Minimal ✨

For the new portfolio, I focused on **simplicity and clarity**:

- 🧹 Less clutter → only the most important content stays
- 🎨 A minimal color palette → easier on the eyes
- 🖋️ Modern typography → more professional feel
- 📱 Responsive & clean layouts → looks good everywhere

This time, the design gets out of the way and lets the work shine. You don’t have to scroll through a rainbow of distractions just to see what I’ve built.

## Under the Hood (for the curious 👩‍💻👨‍💻)

Even though this post is about design, I know some folks might be curious about the stack. The tech stayed pretty much the same — **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS** — but I also added **shadcn/ui** to speed things up and give everything a polished feel.

Both versions (old and new) are open-source, so if you want to peek under the hood:

## What I Learned Along the Way

- **Simple > Flashy** → A portfolio isn’t about showing _everything_, it’s about showing the _right_ things.
- **Design is communication** → Clean layouts help recruiters (and anyone else) actually _understand_ my work faster.
- **Iteration matters** → I had to go through the messy first version before realizing what I really wanted.

## Wrapping Up 🎁

This redesign wasn’t just about changing colors or layouts. It was about stepping back and asking: _what’s the point of my portfolio?_

And the answer is simple: to make it easy for people to see who I am, what I’ve built, and why they might want to work with me.

So… here it is! My portfolio’s new chapter — simpler, cleaner, and hopefully a lot easier to love ❤️.
